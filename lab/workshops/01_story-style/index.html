            1) i like gross websites. I misread ‘basic shapes’ in microsoft powerpoint. for the longest time i thought basic shapes was pronounced ‘basca shapes’ and no one corrected me
                (jpeg)
            2) it was one of those older Windows operating systems and I’d right click to save the silly gifs onto the computer at home.
                (windows audio)
            3) i don’t think i actually knew where all the different photos and gifs went. I just knew that they were somewhere on computer.
                (video)
            4) i hadn’t figured out how files work and how you’re suppose to select where you want to save your photos and gifs to.
                (/)
            5) i was on call with my ex a while back and I came to the conclusion that i like useless things.
