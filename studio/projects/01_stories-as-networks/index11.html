            The poem is the <span class="begin">consequence</span> of its <span class="begin">origins</span>. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. 

            Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems <span class="begin">End</span>, says this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also <span class="begin">released</span>. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those <span class="begin">expectations</span> that are <span class="begin">aroused</span> are also <span class="begin">fulfilled</span>.”

            But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems <span class="begin">begin</span>. How can the <span class="begin">origin</span> be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of the <span class="begin">big bang</span>, we can go back to a nanosecond before the <span class="begin">beginning</span>, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise <span class="begin">beginning</span> because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was <span class="begin">born</span>.
