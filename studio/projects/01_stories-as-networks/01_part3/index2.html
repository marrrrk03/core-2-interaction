            paul valéry, the french poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever <span class="begin">ended</span>, that every poem is merely abandoned. this saying is also attributed to stéphane mallarmé, for where quotations <span class="begin">begin</span> is in a cloud. 

            paul valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the <span class="begin">opening line</span> of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.
