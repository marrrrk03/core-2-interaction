            I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of <span class="begin">opening</span> and <span class="begin">closing lines</span>, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that <span class="begin">first lines</span> are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that <span class="begin">last lines</span> are remarkably similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading these <span class="begin">first</span> and <span class="begin">last lines</span>, that there are not only the <span class="begin">first</span> and <span class="begin">last lines</span> of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the <span class="begin">first</span> and <span class="begin">last lines</span> of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that <span class="begin">beginning</span> and that <span class="begin">end</span> are the same: in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the <span class="begin">first</span> something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a <span class="begin">refrain</span>: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. 

            But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s <span class="begin">last words</span> (in a letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was <span class="begin">finally</span> time to go in. And it was.
