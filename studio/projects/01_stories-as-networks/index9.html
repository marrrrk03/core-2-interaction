            Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to <span class="begin">finish</span> any piece of writing: the <span class="begin">ending</span> will have the last word or the <span class="begin">ending</span> will be silent or the <span class="begin">ending</span> will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent. 

            Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We <span class="begin">begin</span> in admiration and we <span class="begin">end</span> by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it. 

            I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are <span class="begin">conceding</span> that in the <span class="begin">beginning</span> was the act, not the word.
